## 🌍 The Problem We’re Solving

In a fast-paced world, mental wellness is often ignored or misunderstood. Many people struggle silently with stress, anxiety, overthinking, and emotional burnout — but hesitate to reach out or find time to care for their mental health. Therapy may not always be accessible, and self-care often takes a back seat.

## 💡 What is Nirvana?

**Nirvana** is an AI-powered mental wellness app designed to make emotional care simple, private, and consistent. It's like a pocket therapist, a mood companion, and a daily self-care coach — all in one.

With mindful designs and illustrations, Nirvana helps you reconnect with yourself through calming features that support your emotional well-being.
